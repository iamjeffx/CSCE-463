# CSCE-463
All project code for CSCE 463. This course was taken with Professor Dmitri Loguinov. Don't copy code if you are taking this class. The textbook used for this course is *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach 6 Ed.*. A link to the course website is provided [**here**](http://irl.cse.tamu.edu/courses/463/). 

## Usage
To copy this repository, simply type the following into any command line (note that *git* must be installed). 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamjeffx/CSCE-463.git
```
All project code is designed to run within Visual Studio 2019. Make sure that precompiled headers are turned on for the project (create them using *pch.cpp* and use them for the main function). Also, make sure that *x64* is used in case lots of RAM is used. Turn Whole Program Optimization off when compiling for *Release* mode (in case of explicitly placed *lib* files).
